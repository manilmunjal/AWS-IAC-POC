## üìñ Overview

This Proof of Concept (POC) aims to:

- Demonstrate the power of **Terraform** as an effective tool for **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.
- Automate the provisioning of AWS resources, showcasing the potential for scaling and managing infrastructure.
- Promote the use of **reusable**, **scalable**, and **modular** Terraform code that can be adapted for various cloud architectures.

## üîß Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1. **Terraform CLI**:  
   Install Terraform by following the official [Terraform Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
   
2. **AWS CLI**:  
   Install and configure AWS CLI using the instructions provided in the official [AWS CLI User Guide](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
   Configure your AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

3. **AWS Account**:  
   Ensure you have an AWS account with the **necessary permissions** to create and manage resources.

4. **Terraform Backend** (Optional but recommended):  
   Configure a remote backend (e.g., AWS S3) for storing the **Terraform state**. Modify the `backend` block in `Terraform-vpc/provider.tf` to match your S3 bucket name.

## üöÄ Usage

### Manual Terraform Usage

Follow these steps for manual provisioning of AWS resources using Terraform:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manilmunjal/AWS-IAC-POC.git
   cd AWS-IAC-POC
   cd Terraform-vpc
   ```

2. Initialize the Terraform environment:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Validate the Terraform configuration files:

   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

4. Create an execution plan for Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the configuration to provision resources:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action when prompted.

6. If necessary, destroy the provisioned infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

### Automated GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

For automated deployment and management of AWS resources, this repository is integrated with GitHub Actions.

#### Triggering the Terraform CI/CD Pipeline

This section explains how to manually trigger the Terraform CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions for deploying AWS resources.

##### **Steps to Trigger the Workflow**

1. **Navigate to GitHub Actions**:
   - Open your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the **Actions** tab.

2. **Locate the Terraform Workflow**:
   - Find the **Terraform CI/CD pipeline for Deploy AWS resources** workflow on the left side.
   - Click on it to open the details.

3. **Trigger the Workflow**:
   - Click on **Run workflow** on the right side.
   - Select the following options:
     - **Workspace**: Choose from `dev`, `test`, or `prod`.
     - **Deployment Type**: Choose `deploy` or `destroy`.
   - Click **Start workflow**.

4. **Monitor the Workflow**:
   - Refresh the page to view the workflow progress. The workflow will execute the following steps:
     - **Terraform Init**: Initializes Terraform.
     - **Terraform Validate**: Validates the configuration.
     - **Workspace Selection**: Selects the workspace.
     - **Terraform Plan**: Previews the deployment or destruction.
     - **Terraform Apply/Destroy**: Applies the changes or destroys resources.

##### **Input Details**

- **Workspace**: Choose the environment (`dev`, `test`, or `prod`).
- **Deployment Type**: Choose `deploy` to deploy or `destroy` to remove resources.

#### **Conclusion**

By following the above steps, you can easily trigger and monitor the Terraform CI/CD pipeline for deploying or destroying resources in your selected workspace.

## üèóÔ∏è Resources Provisioned

This POC provisions the following AWS resources:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: A custom VPC to host resources.
- **Subnets**: Multiple subnets for better resource segregation.
- **Security Groups**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Internet Gateway**: Provides internet access for resources in public subnets.
- **Route Tables & Associations**: Manages routing of internet traffic.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes incoming traffic across EC2 instances.
- **EC2 Instances**: Virtual machines to run applications.
